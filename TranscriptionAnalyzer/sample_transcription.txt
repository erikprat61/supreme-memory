Meeting: Project Kickoff
Date: 2023-11-15
Participants: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David

Alice: Good morning everyone! Thanks for joining our project kickoff meeting. Today we'll be discussing the new mobile app project.

Bob: Thanks for having us. I've prepared some initial wireframes that we can review.

Charlie: Great! I've been working on the backend architecture. I think we should use a microservices approach with Kubernetes for deployment.

David: That sounds good. What about the database? Should we go with PostgreSQL or MongoDB?

Alice: I think PostgreSQL would be a better fit for our relational data. Bob, can you walk us through the wireframes?

Bob: Sure! The main screen will have a dashboard with key metrics. Users can navigate to different sections using the bottom navigation bar.

Charlie: How will we handle authentication? I'm thinking OAuth with JWT tokens.

David: That works for me. What's our timeline for the first MVP?

Alice: We're aiming for a three-month development cycle. I'd like to have something we can show to stakeholders by the end of January.

Bob: That's tight, but doable if we prioritize the core features.

Charlie: I agree. We should focus on the essential user journeys first.

David: What about testing? Should we set up CI/CD from the beginning?

Alice: Yes, absolutely. We'll use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Charlie, can you set that up?

Charlie: Will do. I'll create the initial pipeline next week.

Bob: For the UI, I'm thinking we should use React Native to target both iOS and Android.

David: Sounds good. What about the design system? Should we create our own or use an existing one?

Alice: Let's use Material UI as our base and customize it to match our brand guidelines.

Bob: I'll update the wireframes accordingly.

Charlie: What about the API documentation? Should we use Swagger?

David: Yes, Swagger would be perfect. It will help with both documentation and testing.

Alice: Great! Let's summarize our action items:
1. Bob will finalize the wireframes by next Friday
2. Charlie will set up the CI/CD pipeline and backend architecture
3. David will create the database schema
4. I'll handle the project management and stakeholder communication

Bob: Sounds like a plan!

Charlie: I'll send out a summary email with these action items.

David: Thanks everyone! Looking forward to working on this project.

Alice: Meeting adjourned. We'll reconvene next week for our first sprint planning.
